# Mental rotation experiment

This repository contains an example of a _magpie experiment.

## Procedure

The partcipants will be shown 60 stimuli in total of which 12 are practice trials and the remaining 48 are main trials.

In each trial the subject will be presented with two images of 3D objects which are constructed of a varying amount of cubes.
The objects are either completely the same or different in their orientation.
In every trial the participant has to decide which of these two is the case.

If they identify the objects as the same, one should press key 'f' but if they think they are different in respect to their orientation
the subject is to press key 'j'.
